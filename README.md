Here is an overview of my Data-Analysis Projects:

[Analysis of TMDb movie data](investigating_movie_data.html)
In this project I analyze a dataset with informtion of over 10,000 movies collected by The Internet Movie Database. I make use of the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib to wrangle, analyze the dataset and to illustrate my finding.
